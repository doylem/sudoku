Constant Time: O(1) - The algorithm's runtime remains constant regardless of the input size.

Linear Time: O(n) - The algorithm's runtime grows linearly with the input size. As the input size increases by a factor of n, the runtime also increases by a factor of n.

Quadratic Time: O(n^2) - The algorithm's runtime grows quadratically with the input size. As the input size increases by a factor of n, the runtime increases by a factor of n squared.

Cubic Time: O(n^3) - The algorithm's runtime grows cubically with the input size. As the input size increases by a factor of n, the runtime increases by a factor of n cubed.

Exponential Time: O(2^n) - The algorithm's runtime grows exponentially with the input size. As the input size increases by a factor of n, the runtime doubles. This is often considered to be inefficient for large input sizes.
